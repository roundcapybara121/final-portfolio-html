                    and analyze flaws in the interface in order to brainstorm possible improvements to the site. I
                    created mockups to visualize the changes I was going to make and then attempted to code those
                    changes into a responsive website.

                <p>These were the usability issues I noticed with the site:</p>

                        Too much scrolling to get information

                            <li class="list-inner">
                                The quick links on the right side doesn’t follow you so not easily accessible

                                It’s not clear that some of the text can act as a link . You have to hover over it first
                                to see that it changes color
                            </li>

                        Links doesn’t bring you directly to the product or author page, only brings you to the general
                        site and you’ll have to search for things related to the author yourself

                        The column on the right side contains the same information which can be repetitive with links

                <p><a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAim</a> is a website where you can paste in another website’s URL in
                    which WebAim will access how accessible the website is for users. It will examine properties such as
                    color contrasts, fonts sizes, layout of components and more to determine a score for how accessible
                    a site is.
                </p>
                <p>The website was put into WebAim Wave to examine for accessibility issues and this was the result:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list-outer">Images did not contain alt tags, people who use screen readers will not
                        be able to know that there is an image
                    </li>
                    <li class="list-outer">A heading element was used as padding when it should just be padding that
                        is used

                            <li class="list-inner">
                                Using heading elements can be confusing if the information is empty

                    team, it makes handoffs to other developers easier. Within Figma, I created a guide to use for
                    redesigning Suzzane Collin’s website. It includes the main colors, typography, and components in
                    different states.</p>

                <p>I was extremely new to web developing and ran into trouble with coding parts of my code. Using online
                    tutorials, I figured out how to make the navigation bar responsive through media queuries and other
                    CSS tools. However, I couldn't quite figure out how to remove the background color of the icons.
                    Additionally, I had tried to use z-indexes in order to keep the navigation bar at the top, yet when
                    I uploaded the pages onto github, the images lay on top of the navigation bar when testing for
                    responsiveness.</p>
