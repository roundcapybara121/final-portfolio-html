                <p class="section-text">The microwave is a simple appliance found in many people’s homes. Its
                    interface should be clear and concise as it is advertised to be a quick and easy way to prepare
                    a meal. However, what if the interface is difficult to navigate? In this project, I explore
                    three users’ interactions with the interface of the microwave in the Goddard Kitchen of Brown
                    University. To further display and understand the decision making behind UX design, I created a
                    persona and storyboard based on these users.

                </div>
                <p>Though the microwave is relatively new, it lacks the number pad seen in modern microwaves. “Time
                    cook” allows one to input a set time to cook food. Other buttons offer a present time to reheat
                    food quickly.

                <p>I watched as three users attempted to heat up a meal using this microwave. This is the general
                    trend that I observed among users.

                    <li>The knob was an interesting implementation that they found amusing</li>
                    <li>Users often asked where the instructions were</li>

                    understand how they felt about the interface.

                <p>Personas are character archetypes that represent the spectrum of users for a product, or design.
                    They are mainly used in product design so designers are able to create layouts that make them
                    feel the most comfortable. From my previous observations and interview results, I created two
                    personas based on the trend of my data. These personas are in the form of a four-quadrant
                    empathy map describing what a user might think, feel, say, and do. </p>

                <p>Picking father Philip as the persona, I created a storyboard. Storyboards are meant to show a
                    user’s journey from start to end and how they might interact with the interface. It displays
                    their emotions and actions, and gives designers a chance to better personify/characterize a
                    potential client. </p>

                        <p>1. It is 8pm. Philip comes home late from work, exhausted. His stomach rumbles and he
                            starts to wonder what there is to eat at home.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>2. He surfs through his phone and realizes his favorite supermarket is closed for the
                            day. He thinks to himself, "good thing I have leftovers."

                        <p>3. After picking up his kids from the babysitter, he heads straight for the fridge. He
                            scavenges through for a bit until he finally finds a large bowl of rice and pieces of
                            frozen chicken.

                        <p>4. He places the chicken in the microwave and hits defrost. While the chicken was warming
                            up, he turns towards the rice and thinks about how long he wants to cook it for. "Let's
                            go for 3 minutes," he tells to himself.
                        </p>

                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>5. His children stare at him, waiting patiently for their food. Until one of them finally
                            squeaks, "when is dinner ready, dad?" Philip answers, "just a minute!" as he stares at
                            the microwave, perplexed. How was he going to set the microwave for 3 minutes if there
                            was no number pad to input 3 minutes?
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>6. Philip starts to press the buttons at random. He presses, "start", nothing happened.
                            He presses "power," a screen asking "power level?" pops up. Then he presses "time cook"
                            and finally sees that there is some progress.
                        </p>

                    <div class="panel">

                        <p>7. The screen displays "time: 00:00". He twists the knob, hoping that it'll work. It
                            does. He then hits start and nothing happens. A headache starts to set in.
                        </p>

                        <p>8. He unplugs the microwave and plugs it back in hoping that it would work, but it
                            doesn't. He tries over and over again, thinking that the microwave might just be broken.
                            Then, his hand fumbles over the knob and he hears a click. "You can press the knob?" he
                            exclaims.
                        </p>

                        <p>9. He hits "start". The microwave starts to hum and Philip feels a wave of relief wash
                            over him.
                        </p>

                        <p>10. He pulls out the rice from the microwave, turns towards his children and announced,
                            "let's eat!". After a long day, they finally get to enjoy this meal together.
