                <p class="section-text">The goal of this project was to develop an interactive interface, use
                    interface components, and tie the components to an internal data state using React JS. I created a
                    list-based interface centered around buying plants.

                <h1 class="work-section-title">Design Process</h1>
                <p>Thinking as an online shopper, there are things we find convenient such as a sorting function or
                    filtering function in order to find items quickly. Additionally, an aggregator is necessary to see
                    the total price and relieve some responsibility from the user of having to calculate it themselves.
                </p>
                <h3>Organization of Components</h3>
                <p>
                    I have 2 components: 1 for card with a plant's information and 1 for the item in a cart. The plant
                    item card component is located in plantItem.js and requires me to pass in information for it from
                    App.js for the cards to be displayed. Once the add to cart button of a card is hit, this will update
                    the cart's state and include the name of the plant that was added. In App.js, I made a component
                    that goes through each cart item and create a remove button.
                </p>
                <h3>Usability Principles for Layout and Hierarchy</h3>
                <p>
                    Each image in the item card has an alt tag to remain accessible for certain people who use text to
                    speech. To give users an easier time to navigate through the website, I laid out hierachy using
                    color and different font sizes/weights. For the website name and subsection headings, I used the
                    font style "limelight" to indicate some importance. For smaller texts that display extra
                    information, I used the font style "Courier New". I group information into a block of color. For
                    example, each plant card has a dark green background compared to the light green used as the site's
                    background. To further distiguish the cards from one another, I added an orange border. To improve
                    learnability, I made sure all the buttons were the same style with an orange border, light green
                    background, and text in the middle indicating what the button does. Additionally, the overall layout
                    will not change from sorting or filtering. The plants will remain on the left and the options to
                    change will stay on the right. Operations are simple, usually requiring a click to activate
                    something and then a reclick to turn it off. Hopefully this will improve memorability because
                    operations shouldn't be overally complicated and I have also included some small descriptions in
                    case there is any confusion.

                <h1 class="work-section-title">Goal of Application and Value to Users</h1>
                <p>This application can be used by businesses to sell plants online. This removes the need for an
                    employee to manage business transactions and allows the consumer direct control over what they buy.
                    For consumers, they can easily all the plants this stores sells and have costs calculated for them.
                    This allows them to have more time to focus on whether they have enough money, or if they want to
                    get certain items, in which they can remove from cart if they don't like it anymore. Further
                    development of the site can lead to actual transactions or more calculations such as taxes and
                    shipping costs.
